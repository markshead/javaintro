     * Make this method return a String that says:
     * Hello World
     * To tell the computer where a string starts 
     * and stops you must put it in quotes. 
     * 
     *   Notice that the return type of the method
     *   begins with a capital S whereas all the 
     *   previous return types started with lower
     *   case letters.  That is because a String
     *   is a special type of type called an object.
     *   We will talk more about objects later, but
     *   for now just notice that String is spelled
     *   with a capital S.
